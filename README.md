# scheduler

W.I.P.

This is a tool designed to help my team be used most effectively and fairly.
This is accomplished by defining what employees should be added to the program, the days those employees work, and what roles or jobs those employees have.
The program then loops through the data to generate a schedule that is fair and assigns employees to the roles or jobs they excel at.
